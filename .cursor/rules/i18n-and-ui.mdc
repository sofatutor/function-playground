## UI & i18n Conventions

- Use Shadcn UI primitives from `src/components/ui` for consistency.
- Ensure accessibility: proper roles/labels, keyboard navigation, focus management.
- Any user-facing text must be translatable. Update:
  - Dictionaries in [src/locales](mdc:src/locales)
  - Translation utilities in [src/i18n](mdc:src/i18n)
- Keep UI logic lean; push business/geometry logic into services or utils.
- Memoize heavy computations; avoid excessive event handlers; debounce where appropriate.
