## E2E Guidelines (Playwright)

- The dev server runs automatically (see `webServer` in [playwright.config.ts](mdc:playwright.config.ts)). Do not start another server in tests.
- Prefer waiting on selectors/state over arbitrary timeouts; keep global timeouts as configured.
- Use stable selectors; avoid brittle text-only selectors when structure is available.
- Capture failures with built-in trace/screenshots; artifacts output to `test-results/`.
- Keep tests independent; do not rely on execution order; prefer `test.step` for clarity.
