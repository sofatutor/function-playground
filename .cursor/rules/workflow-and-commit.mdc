## Working Agreement & Process (adapted for this repo)

### Core Workflow Rules
- Keep [README.md](mdc:README.md) and docs in `docs/` accurate when changing features or flows.
- Small, focused edits. Follow SRP/DRY/KISS; keep TypeScript types explicit.
- UI changes use Shadcn components; ensure accessibility.

### TDD & Quality
- Write or update tests alongside code.
- Prefer table-driven/component-focused tests with React Testing Library.
- Maintain or improve coverage on changed areas; avoid adding tests for unused code.

### Git conventions
- Atomic commits with prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
- No WIP/TODO/FIXME comments in committed code.
- Group related changes; avoid unrelated formatting churn.

### Pre-push checklist
- `npm run lint` is clean.
- `npm run test` green; run `npm run test:coverage` for core logic changes.
- For flows touched by UI/state changes, run E2E: `npm run e2e`.
- No secrets or large artifacts added.
