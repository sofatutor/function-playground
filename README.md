[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mfittko/geo-playground/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://coveralls.io/github/mfittko/geo-playground?branch=main)

Geo-Playground is an interactive web application for creating and manipulating geometric shapes. It provides a canvas where you can draw, move, resize, and rotate various shapes, as well as measure their properties.

## Features

- Create various shapes (circles, rectangles, triangles, lines)
- Select and manipulate shapes
- Move, resize, and rotate shapes
- Measure shape properties (area, perimeter, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Responsive design
- Zoom controls with keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- Triangle angle and side measurement with interactive editing
- Function plotting with support for:
  - Basic arithmetic operations
  - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
  - Logarithmic functions
  - Rational functions
  - Complex composite functions
- Scale shapes with precise controls
- Interactive canvas with grid system
- Point info tool for precise coordinate and function value tracking
- Grid panning/dragging for easy navigation across the canvas

## Project Structure

The application follows a service-based architecture with a clean separation of concerns:

- **Components**: React components for the UI
- **Services**: Shape services for business logic
- **Utilities**: Utility functions for geometry operations
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- [API Documentation](docs/api-documentation.md): Detailed documentation of the shape services and utilities
- [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md): Overview of the application architecture
- [User Guide](docs/user-guide.md): Guide for end users

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manuelfittko/geo-playground.git
cd geo-playground

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Production Deployment
- Production deployment is triggered automatically on pushing to the `main` branch
- The GitHub Actions workflow handles testing and deploying to Vercel
- You can monitor deployment status in the GitHub Actions tab

### Manual Deployment
To deploy manually:

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm install --global vercel`
2. Log in to Vercel: `vercel login`
3. Run: `vercel` (for preview) or `vercel --prod` (for production)

### Required Secrets
For the automated deployment to work, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel API token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Your Vercel project ID

## Using the Application

### Drawing Shapes
- Use the shape tools (triangle, rectangle, circle) to create shapes on the canvas
- Click and drag to define size and position
- Shapes remain at the drawn position until manually moved

### Manipulating Triangles
- Click on a triangle to select it and view its measurements
- Click directly on angle or side measurements to edit them
- Editing an angle will update the triangle shape while maintaining the sum of angles (180Â°)
- Editing a side will proportionally adjust the other sides to maintain the triangle's shape

### Function Plotting
- Click the "Plot Formula" button to enter function plotting mode
- Use the "Add Function" button to create a new function
- Enter expressions like `x*x`, `sin(x)`, `log(x)`, `tan(x)`, or complex formulas like `sin(x) * cos(x*2)`
- Supported operations include arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and rational functions
- Functions update in real-time as you enter them
- Click on points along the function graph to activate the point info panel with precise coordinates and calculations
- Use left/right arrow navigation in the point info panel to move along the function curve with defined step size
- Configure formula parameters with custom ranges and step sizes:
  - Set minimum and maximum values for each parameter
  - Adjust step size for fine-grained control
  - Use sliders for quick parameter adjustments
  - Parameters are automatically detected from the formula expression

### Zoom Controls
- Use the zoom buttons or keyboard shortcuts to zoom in/out
- Arrow Up/Down for zoom control
- Ctrl + '+' to zoom in
- The current zoom level is displayed as a percentage

### Point Info Tool
- View detailed coordinate information by hovering over points on graphs
- See exact X and Y coordinates of any point on a function graph
- View the calculation used to determine the Y value at specific X coordinates
- Navigate between points on a function using arrow controls with customizable step size
- Alt+Click to access additional measurement options

### Grid Navigation
- Click and drag on the empty canvas to pan/move the grid in any direction
- Combine grid dragging with zoom controls for easy navigation across large diagrams
- Grid maintains object positions while allowing you to focus on different areas
- Alt+Click to move only the grid origin without affecting shapes
- Alt+Shift+Click to move both the grid and all shapes together

## Technologies

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Jest (for unit testing)
- Playwright (for end-to-end testing)

## Recent Improvements

1. **Service-Based Architecture**: Implemented a service-based architecture for shape operations
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added extensive unit tests with >80% code coverage
3. **Improved Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types and added runtime type checking
4. **Better Organization**: Reorganized code into smaller, more focused modules
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed documentation for developers and users

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests using Jest
- End-to-end tests using Playwright

### End-to-End Testing

E2E tests simulate user interactions to ensure the application works correctly from a user's perspective. 

Running E2E tests:

- `npm run e2e` - Run all E2E tests
- `npm run e2e:ci` - Run E2E tests in CI mode with GitHub reporting
- `npm run e2e:ci:debug` - Run E2E tests with debug logging enabled
- `npm run e2e:open` - Open Playwright UI for interactive testing
- `npm run e2e:debug` - Run tests in debug mode

### Debug Logging

The E2E tests use a debug logging system that suppresses verbose output by default. 
To see detailed logs, use the `e2e:ci:debug` command or set the `DEBUG=true` environment variable.

```bash
# Run with debug logs
npm run e2e:ci:debug

# Or manually set the DEBUG env variable
DEBUG=true npm run e2e:ci
```
